This project was to be able to create a code that could assist and translate a text file from fahrenheit temperature to celsius.
I think I did a good job making sure the operation would work smoothly.
The program executes reading the correct file and converts the temperature to Celsius with proper decimals.
One thing I could improve on that I learned from further research would be using â€œ<iomanip>.
It helps keep things more concise and efficiently would dictate how many decimals spots were needed for the translation of Fahrenheit to Celsius.
This most challenging part of this project was figuring how to properly get the file to be read with the code.
I was excited to learn how to read files and I could see how this is an incredibly useful skill. 
I think that this project was made maintainable and readable because I used simple but specific variable names and also commented out what was going on throughout the project.
This made the code more easy to understand.
